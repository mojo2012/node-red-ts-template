# Setup

Steps:
* Run `npm install`
* copy .env.template to .env
* Run `npm run build`
* Run `npm run launch`

Now you can access node-red via your browser under http://localhost:1880.

You can play with the DummyNode.

If you are using vscode, you can directly launch node-red via the debug menu and fully debug your code (quit the npm run lanch command first though).

Have fun!
